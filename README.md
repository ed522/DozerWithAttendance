# This repository is outdated. See the one at [https://github.com/ed522/NewDozer] for the correct version.

### This is a forked version of the original at https://github.com/Graham277/NewDozer. Original readme below

## About
A python rewrite of the original dozer-discord-bot.
Much of this project is powered by the blue alliance at https://www.thebluealliance.com/

## Setup
1. To run the bot, create a file called ".env" in the project root.
2. Add your token to the file in this form: 
    ```
    token=YourTokenHere
    ```
3. Add the id of the guild the bot will be run on to the dotenv.
    This provides instant syncing to the guild and is required for this bot.
     ```
    guild_id=YourGuildIdHere
    ```
4. (Optional) If doing development, you can add a "dev_guild_id" as well, and the commands will sync to both guilds.
    This allows you to develop and test the status on your own server without clogging up the production server.
5. Run main.py

Requires the discord.py and dotenv libraries
